We provide two novel applications of `ngsJulia` for low-coverage short-read sequencing data.
* [ngsPloidy](https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsJulia/tree/master/ngsPloidy) infers the ploidy of samples from genotype likelihoods.
* [ngsPool](https://github.com/mfumagalli/ngsJulia/tree/master/ngsPool) estimates allele frequencies (and more) from pooled-sequencing data.
