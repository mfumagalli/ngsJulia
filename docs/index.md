Templates and functions in Julia language to process next-generation sequencing (NGS) data for population genetic analysis.
`ngsJulias` receives NGS data files as input and provides routines and functions to parse files, perform data filtering and implement custom population genetic analyses.

We provide two novel applications of ngsJulia for low-coverage short-read sequencing data. `ngsPloidy` infers the ploidy of samples from genotype likelihoods, `ngsPool` estimates allele frequencies (and more) from pooled-sequencing data.
