Templates and functions in Julia language to process next-generation sequencing (NGS) data for population genetic analysis.
`ngsJulias` receives NGS data files as input and provides routines and functions to parse files, perform data filtering and implement custom population genetic analyses.
Two implementations for analysing pooled sequencing data and polyploid genomes are further presented.
